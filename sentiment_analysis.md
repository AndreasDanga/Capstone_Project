## Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis is a technique used to determine the sentiment or emotion expressed in a piece of text, such as a news article, social media post, or customer review. The goal of sentiment analysis in this project is to evaluate the perception of ESG companies over time by analyzing news articles and other sources of information.

To perform sentiment analysis, we can use Python libraries like Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) or spaCy, which provide tools for text preprocessing, tokenization, and part-of-speech tagging. Once we have preprocessed the text data, we can apply machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes or Support Vector Machines to classify the text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

In addition to classifying the overall sentiment of a piece of text, we may also want to extract relevant topics or themes from the text. Topic modeling techniques, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), can be used to extract a set of topics from a collection of documents. This can help us to identify the key themes or topics associated with ESG companies over time.

Overall, sentiment analysis and topic modeling can provide valuable insights into the perception and development of ESG investments over time. By analyzing news articles and other sources of information, we can better understand the factors that influence the perception of ESG companies and how this perception changes over time.
