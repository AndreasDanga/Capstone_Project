# Tools and Libraries

This project will utilize the following tools and libraries:

- Tableau for data visualization
- Postgre SQL for data storage and querying
- DBeaver for database management
- Python for data manipulation and analysis
- Pandas for data manipulation
- NumPy for scientific computing
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for machine learning

## Tableau
Tableau is a powerful data visualization tool that will be used to create compelling visualizations to tell the story of the project.

## Postgre SQL
Postgre SQL is a powerful open-source relational database management system that will be used to store and query data for the project.

## DBeaver
DBeaver is a free and open-source database management tool that will be used to manage the Postgre SQL database for the project.

## Python
Python is a versatile programming language that will be used for data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning. It provides a rich set of libraries for scientific computing, data manipulation, and visualization.

## Pandas
Pandas is a popular library for data manipulation and analysis in Python. It provides fast and efficient data structures for working with structured data, such as tables.

## NumPy
NumPy is a fundamental library for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, as well as a variety of mathematical functions for linear algebra, Fourier analysis, and more.

## Matplotlib and Seaborn
Matplotlib and Seaborn are Python libraries for data visualization. Matplotlib provides a wide range of plotting functions, while Seaborn provides higher-level interfaces for creating more complex visualizations.

## Scikit-learn
Scikit-learn is a popular Python library for machine learning. It provides a variety of algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and more.

## NLTK or spaCy
NLTK and spaCy are Python libraries for natural language processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis. They provide tools for text cleaning, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and more.

## Jupyter Notebook
Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows users to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It will be used for interactive data analysis and development.

## Git and GitHub
Git is a version control system that will be used to track changes to the project codebase, while GitHub is a web-based platform for hosting and collaborating on Git repositories. They will be used for version control and collaboration on the project.
