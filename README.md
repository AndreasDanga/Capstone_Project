# Capstone Project: ESG Investing and Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the development and perception of ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) investments over time. The goal is to create a model that can predict the effect of certain decisions regarding the ESG score of a company. 

The approach involves gathering data on ESG and traditional investments, and using machine learning algorithms to perform sentiment analysis techniques to analyze news, etc. to evaluate the perception of ESG companies. The project will use Tableau to create a compelling story.
